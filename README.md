# Big Data Project  

This repository contains the code and documentation for a Big Data project, focusing on analyzing, processing, and visualizing large-scale datasets. The project demonstrates the application of big data frameworks and tools to derive meaningful insights and solve real-world problems.  



## Features  

The project includes:  
- **Data Collection**: Gathering structured and unstructured data from various sources.  
- **Data Preprocessing**: Cleaning, transforming, and preparing datasets for analysis.  
- **Big Data Frameworks**: Utilizing tools like Hadoop, Spark, or similar technologies.  
- **Analysis and Insights**: Performing advanced analytics using scalable algorithms.  
- **Visualization**: Creating intuitive visualizations to represent trends and findings.  



## Prerequisites  

To run the project, ensure you have the following installed:  
- Python 3.8+  
- Big Data tools such as Hadoop or Apache Spark (installation may vary based on your environment).  
- Python libraries:  
  - Pandas  
  - PySpark  
  - Matplotlib/Seaborn  

Install dependencies using pip:  
```bash  
pip install pandas pyspark matplotlib seaborn  
```  

 

## How to Use  

1. Clone the repository:  
   ```bash  
   git clone https://github.com/ashithapallath/Big-Data-Project.git  
   cd Big-Data-Project  
   ```  

2. Set up your environment:  
   - Configure Hadoop or Spark on your system (refer to their official documentation).  
   - Ensure your datasets are stored in the appropriate input directories.  

3. Run the main script:  
   ```bash  
   python main.py  
   ```  

4. Explore the visualizations and output files generated in the output directory.

## Example Analysis  

### Sample Code: Word Count Using PySpark  
```python  
from pyspark import SparkContext  

sc = SparkContext("local", "Word Count")  

text_file = sc.textFile("data/input.txt")  
counts = text_file.flatMap(lambda line: line.split(" "))  
                 .map(lambda word: (word, 1))  
                 .reduceByKey(lambda a, b: a + b)  

counts.saveAsTextFile("output/word_count")  
```  

### Sample Visualization: Data Trends  
```python  
import pandas as pd  
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt  

df = pd.read_csv("output/results.csv")  
plt.plot(df['Date'], df['Value'])  
plt.title("Data Trends Over Time")  
plt.show()  
```
